# artic-py
A discord bot made with python 3 with some a little help
# Short description
This project originally was made for fun, me learning python with some BIG help from github.com/dmx04
# Why source-code?
The project just made 1 year old and I'm not using anymore python, soo why not?

Did my project help you? give it a star, thanks!
